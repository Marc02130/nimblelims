## Hamilton-specific worklist format

**What:** Add Hamilton .csv worklist format output as an alternative to the generic CSV.

**Why:** Hamilton is the most common liquid handling robot at Series A biotech. Generic CSV works and maps to any robot, but scientists running Hamilton robots will want a native format that loads directly without a field-mapping step.

**Pros:** Reduces friction for the most common robot type at NimbleLIMS's target customer. Unlocks a demo talking point: "it generates a Hamilton worklist directly."

**Cons:** Hamilton format is validated against a specific robot model/firmware version. Needs a real Hamilton worklist to test against before shipping. Minor maintenance burden if Hamilton changes their format.

**Context:** Phase 2 of the NimbleLIMS flexible experiment engine adds robot worklist export as generic CSV (source_well, dest_well, volume). Hamilton format was deliberately deferred until the generic CSV path is validated with a real experiment end-to-end. See design doc: `~/.gstack/projects/garrytan-gstack/marcbreneiser-main-design-20260324-214055.md`.

**Depends on / blocked by:** Generic CSV worklist export (Phase 2) validated with a real experiment run.
