## Recommended Next Script

After completing `uat-configurations-custom`, the recommended next scripts are:
- **`uat-security-rbac`** - If not yet completed (foundational)
- **`uat-container-management`** - Builds on lists/configurations for container workflows
- **`uat-help-system`** - Can run in parallel (independent after security)

## UAT Script: Sidebar Navigation — Experiments Section Visibility & Experiment Templates

**Prerequisites:** uat-security-rbac (roles and permissions). Default logins: admin/admin123, lab-tech/labtech123, lab-manager/labmanager123, client/client123.

**Objective:** Verify the Experiments accordion appears for the correct roles and that **Experiment Templates** is visible to every role that has **`experiment:manage`** (Administrator, Lab Manager, Lab Technician in default seed).

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Log in as **Administrator** | Sidebar shows **Experiments** accordion (between Sample Mgmt and Lab Mgmt). |
| 2 | Expand Experiments | Sub-items: **All Experiments**, **Experiment Templates**. |
| 3 | Click "All Experiments" | Navigate to `/experiments`; list page loads; AppBar title "Experiments". |
| 4 | Click "Experiment Templates" | Navigate to `/experiments/templates`; AppBar title "Experiment Templates"; template management page loads. |
| 5 | Log in as **Lab Manager** | Sidebar shows **Experiments** accordion. |
| 6 | Expand Experiments | **All Experiments** and **Experiment Templates** both visible. |
| 7 | Log in as **Lab Technician** | Same as Lab Manager: both sub-items visible. |
| 8 | Log in as **Client** | **Experiments** accordion not visible in sidebar. |
| 9 | As Client, navigate directly to `/experiments` | Redirect to `/dashboard` (permission redirect). |
| 10 | As Client, navigate directly to `/experiments/templates` | Redirect to `/dashboard` (permission redirect). |

**Pass criteria:** Admin, Lab Manager, and Lab Technician see both sub-items and can open `/experiments/templates`; Client does not see Experiments section and cannot open experiment routes by URL.

**Detailed template/SOP/sign-off cases:** See `UAT_Scripts/uat-experiment-templates.md`.

## UAT Script: Experiment Management (CRUD, Linking, Workflow, Lineage)

**Prerequisites:** uat-security-rbac; optional uat-sample-accessioning (for linking samples to experiments). Log in as admin or lab-manager/lab-tech with experiment:manage.

**Objective:** Verify experiment list/detail, create/update, sample↔experiment linking, "My Experiments" filter, lineage view, and workflow actions (create_experiment, link_sample_to_experiment, etc.).

### List & filters

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Go to **Experiments** → All Experiments | List loads with pagination; Status and Type (Template) filters work. |
| 2 | Click **My Experiments** chip | URL gets `?mine=true`; list shows only experiments created by current user. |
| 3 | Click chip again | `mine` removed from URL; full list restored. |

### CRUD

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 4 | Click **New Experiment** | Create dialog opens; name (required), description, template, status. |
| 5 | Submit with name only | Experiment created; redirect to `/experiments/:id` (detail view). |
| 6 | On detail, verify tabs | Overview, Sample Executions, Details/Steps, Lineage, Linked Processes. |
| 7 | Edit experiment (if UI exposed) | PATCH updates name/description/status/template. |

### Sample ↔ experiment linking

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 8 | From experiment detail, **Sample Executions** tab | Table of linked samples; link to sample opens `/samples?highlight=<sample_id>` (bidirectional). |
| 9 | Open a sample that is linked to an experiment | Sample detail shows "Participated in these Experiments" with link to `/experiments/:id`. |
| 10 | From Samples list, open URL `/samples?highlight=<id>` | Sample view dialog opens for that ID (bidirectional link from Experiments). |

### Lineage

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 11 | On experiment detail, open **Lineage** tab | Loading state then template (if any) and linked experiment IDs; expandable linked experiments. |
| 12 | Experiment with no template and no links | Message "No template or linked experiments." or equivalent. |

### Workflow integration

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 13 | In **Admin** → Workflow Templates, create or open a template | Steps JSON can include actions: `create_experiment`, `create_experiment_from_template`, `link_sample_to_experiment`, `add_experiment_detail_step`, `link_experiments`, `update_experiment_status`. |
| 14 | Execute a template that includes `create_experiment_from_template` (with valid experiment_template_id in params) | Execution succeeds; context includes `experiment_id` for downstream steps. |
| 15 | Execute step `link_sample_to_experiment` (experiment_id from context, sample_id in params) | Sample linked to experiment; context includes `execution_id` (experiment_sample_execution id). |

### Back button & titles

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 16 | On experiment detail page | AppBar shows back button (←); click navigates to `/experiments`. |
| 17 | Page titles | List: "Experiments"; detail: "Experiment Detail"; templates route: "Experiment Templates". |

**Pass criteria:** List, filters, CRUD, bidirectional sample↔experiment links, lineage display, and workflow actions behave as above; no regression in Sample Mgmt, Lab Mgmt, or Admin sections.

## Notes

- Scripts can be run out of order if prerequisites are manually set up in the database
- Some scripts can run in parallel if they don't share dependencies (e.g., `uat-navigation-ui` and `uat-help-system`)
- Failed tests in foundational scripts (security, configurations) may cause cascading failures in dependent scripts

---

## Summary — Files Created/Modified (UAT log and scripts)

**This file (`UAT_Scripts/uat-testing-log.md`) modified:**
- Added script dependency rows for `uat-experiments-navigation` and `uat-experiment-management`.
- Updated dependency diagram to include both scripts.
- Added Completion Log rows (pending) for both.
- Added full **UAT Script: Sidebar Navigation — Experiments Section Visibility & Experiment Templates** (steps 1–10; aligned with `experiment:manage` for templates).
- Added full **UAT Script: Experiment Management (CRUD, Linking, Workflow, Lineage)** (steps 1–17 across list/filters, CRUD, sample↔experiment linking, lineage, workflow integration, back button & titles).
- Added dependency row **uat-experiment-templates** and script file `UAT_Scripts/uat-experiment-templates.md`.
- Added this Summary: files touched include `UAT_Scripts/uat-testing-log.md` and `UAT_Scripts/uat-experiment-templates.md`.
